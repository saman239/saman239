                <h2>Introduction</h2>
           
            <p>Factory Records, that name has a lot of history behind it, from their Post-Punk Joy Division beginnings to their New Wave Hacienda years, they affected British music so much in the 80s, but today it is scarce. On this page, we will be delving into a deeper look into Factory Records and the late rave scene as a whole they helped crafting, through photography, audio and video. Tony Wilson was the man behind Factory Records, also known as Mr Manchester, he was arguably the most important man in the British music business of the 80s, pioneering the famous post-punk sound of the band of Joy Division, the new wave movement of New Order and the ‘Second Summer of Love’ rave scene with Happy Mondays. All these bands were cultural giants of their respected genre, and behind all of them was Tony Wilson, Factory Records.
            </p>

             <p> To start with, photography, all photos represent something important to the history of Factory Records. I aimed to give my photos a narrative of Factory Records, from their beginnings being a club called ‘The Factory’ in Hulme, to signing Joy Division, opening up the infamous Hacienda with New Order, to a few decades later to Tony Wilsons death. The last image shows what is left, the club FAC 251, all that remains of the Factory Records name. My photos show Factory Records in the modern-day, a very intentional bleak comparison, which was once the breeding ground of musical culture, now apartments, where one of the most influential bands of all time once stood, now just a simple walkway, lost to history.
            </p>
                
             <p> Next up, the audio piece, a brief touch on the history of Factory Records, the rise and demise. I touch down on all the key moments of their past. I mainly focus on Tony Wilson but do mention other important players that had a hand on the moulding of Factory Records, such as Peter Saville, Peter Hook, etc. My audio mainly focuses’ on the 80s of Factory Records as that was when they were at their peak, making influential moves for the UK music, with their bands and The Hacienda, moves that are still present to this day.
            </p>
                
            <p>Lastly, my video, a short interview with Peter Summers, my father. Here I put Factory Records in cultural context, wherein the music scene they affected, mainly with the last 80s rave scene. Peter is a perfect candidate for the interview as he grew up around Factory Records and their influence. He was part of the cultural landscape we are discussing, he went to The Hacienda, listened to the Factory Records catalogue of bands. Factory Records had under their belt Happy Mondays, a band who had a major hand in developing the ‘Second Summer of Love’ along with other bands like Primal Scream and The Stone Roses, with this interview I was able to collect first-hand anecdotes of what it was like and what Factory Records did for that movement. I also compared the rave scene of the 80s to the current clubbing scene of now, footage taken in FAC 251 played over Peter describing what his experience was like, to show how similar then and now truly are, with the help of Factory Records.

                              <p>This road was the birth of decades of Manchester music, in Spring of 1978 stood a club named The Russell Club, which for one year had a themed night named ‘The Factory’. The club was owned by at the time, newsreader for Granada Reports, Anthony Wilson, who is considered a legend of the Manchester music scene. This club is the beginning of Factory Records, who bands on their label such as; Joy Division, New Order, Happy Mondays, etc. All that remains of this road today are houses and a park, the club was knocked down awhile ago, leaving all for me to capture was the famous street name, with the exposed red brick behind to make it stand out and the tree branch to shadow.</p>

                              <p>The founders of Factory Records, Tony Wilson, Rob Gretton, Alan Erasmus and Martin Hannett, located their first headquarters towards the end of 1978 at 86 Palatine Road, Manchester. At this location was a flat owned by co-founder Alan Erasmus, on the left of the 1st floor is where Factory Records found its first home. In was here where Factory records signed many bands, the first prominent one being Joy Division. This was their headquarters until the early 1990s. Left exactly how it was 40 years ago, my photograph captures the beginning of Factory Records by capturing this iconic house, using the darkness to my advantage so that the house stands out.</p>

                              <p>A recreation of the iconic Joy Division photo, taken on the Epping Walk Bridge in Hulme, Manchester. The original photo was taken on January 6th 1979 by famous music photographer Kevin Cummins. Joy Division lifted Factory Records into stardom. Only a year and a half later did the frontman of Joy Division take his own life at the age of 23, ending the short-lived Joy Division, but the beginning of something new for Factory Records, New Order. The photo is an updated version of Joy Divisions, taken at the same low angle in the same place with an updated scenario for modern time.</p>

                              <p>The Hacienda or FAC 51, which opened its doors in 1982. It was co-owned by Factory Records and New Order, who were the new wave band that was birthed out of Joy Divisions death. It was ground zero for musical movements of the 80s and 90s, even though it was always on the brink of closing down. One of the most famous clubs in the UK. However, it did eventually close down in 1997 and is now a set of apartments of the same name. I included the street and the crossing island to show the Hacienda is now part of suburban Manchester.</p>

                              <p>Here lies Tony Wilson, who passed away on August 10th 2007 at the age. By this point, Factory Records had gone bankrupt in 1992, but Factory Records truly demised when Wilson died of cancer. In Factory Records fashion everything related had a factory number, Wilson's casket was no different, it was FAC 501. His tombstone was designed by Peter Saville, who famously designed and photographed a lot of things for Factories Records. In my photo, I chose the tombstone to be placed to the left side of the image, so you can see it in a sea of tombstones, with a peaking sunrise in the distance.</p>

                              <p>This is all that remains of Factory Records, FAC 251, a club opened in 2010 by New Order bassist Peter Hook. This is not the first time this building was involved with Factory Records, this was also their second headquarters which they moved to in the early 90s. The club consists of three floors all with different music playing. The last thing with the Factory Records name attached to it. I took this photo across the street to capture the full building, with the wet tarmac giving a reflective effect to the photo, and the lights overexposed the stand out in the night.</p>
